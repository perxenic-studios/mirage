> Desert features expanded to incentivise exploration and utilisation

**Mirage** expands underutilised features within hotter biomes such as armadillos to make these underappreciated biomes stand out!

### ✨ Features

* **Become friends with the armadillos:** Make a chestplate out of their scutes that you can wear to prevent scaring them!

* **Bundle Alternatives:** Craft a basket from their scutes so you can organise your inventory without having to kill any animals (Make sure to turn on the bundle experimental feature)

* **Archaeology:** Ruins scattered amongst deserts and badlands with hidden treasure

* **Decoration:** Faded versions of glazed terracotta that can be crafted or found in ruins!

* **More coming soon:** This mod is in very early stages and more vanilla feeling features are on their way!
